1. It is mentioned that we should send Content-Type: text/html
    but if the request for directory indexing, does that mean
    we should allow hyper links ?
2. Server A string identifying this server and version. -> SWS ??
3. Last-Modified The timestamp in GMT of the fileâ€™s last modification date
    What should be returned for a directory ? 
    What should be returned for a invalid file that doesn't exist?
4. Do we need to support <1.0 and >1.0 ??
    What is the expected output for such cases, what will be the status code?
